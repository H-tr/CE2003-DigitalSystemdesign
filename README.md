## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for students taking the CE2003 Digital System Design course. Here, you will find code implementations and lab manuals for all five labs in the course. These labs cover various aspects of digital system design, from vending machines to microprocessor design.

## Labs Overview

Here's an overview of the five labs in this repository:

1. **Lab 1: Simple Vending Machine**
   - Lab Manual: [Lab1_Manual.pdf](CE2003_Lab1.pdf)
   - This lab introduces basic digital logic design concepts using a simple vending machine as a practical example.

2. **Lab 2: Memory Primitives**
   - Lab Manual: [Lab2_Manual.pdf](CE2003_Lab2.pdf)
   - Lab 2 explores memory primitives and their role in digital system design.

3. **Lab 3: Pipelining**
   - Lab Manual: [Lab3_Manual.pdf](CE2003_Lab3.pdf)
   - In this lab, you'll dive into the world of pipelining and understand its significance in digital systems.

4. **Lab 4: Pipelining and Datapath**
   - Lab Manual: [Lab4_Manual.pdf](CE2003_Lab4.pdf)
   - Lab 4 extends the concepts of pipelining to cover the datapath and its implementation.

5. **Lab 5: Microprocessor 16**
   - Lab Manual: [Lab5_Manual.pdf](CE2003_Lab5.pdf)
   - The final lab focuses on the design and understanding of a Microprocessor 16, delving into microprocessor architecture.
